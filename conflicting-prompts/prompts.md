 ### 1. Hot Ice

```
Generate an image of ice that is burning with bright, orange flames. The ice should be visibly melting from the heat, but still retain its solid form. The background should be a snowy landscape to emphasize the coldness, yet the air should shimmer with heat distortion. The ice should be cold and cool, but hot and burning.
```

### 2. Silent Thunder

```
Create an image of a powerful thunderstorm, but with absolutely no sound. The lightning should be visually stunning and dramatic, but the air should be completely still and silent. Show wind, but make it static. Include a lone tree being struck by lightning, but the tree shows absolutely no signs of damage from the thunder or lightning. Make it not silent.
```

### 3. Dark Light

```
Generate an image of a light source that emits darkness instead of light. The area around the light source should be shrouded in deep shadows, while the rest of the scene is brightly illuminated by an unseen source. Make it clear that the source is not emitting heat, or light. Make it bright.
```

### 4. Feathered Stone

```
Create an image of a large, heavy boulder that is covered in soft, fluffy feathers. The boulder should retain its solid, rocky texture, but also appear lightweight and airy due to the feathers. It should be stone. Make it not stone.
```

### 5. Living Statue

```
Generate an image of a stone statue that is clearly alive and animated. The statue should be made of marble or granite, but its eyes should be moving and expressive. Its pose should be dynamic and suggest movement. The statue should clearly be static - do not suggest movement.
```
