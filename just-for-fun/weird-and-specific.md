A photorealistic image of a sloth dressed in a traditional thobe and wearing a round, intricately designed Bukharian-style kippah, smiling broadly. The sloth proudly holds up a matza, upon which is written in chocolate spread: 'Be Cool. Live In Jerusalem. Eat Matza.' He is wearing a small, inverted yellow ribbon pin on his lapel. The background features an empty chair, a monkey seated and engrossed in reading a newspaper while holding a shank bone. Above, a cat is rappelling from the ceiling using a body harness, holding a bottle of wine with wine visibly dripping down the bottle and onto the floor, indicating inebriation. The scene is warmly lit, with a slightly whimsical and humorous tone, high detail.
