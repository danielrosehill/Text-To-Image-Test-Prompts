### In-Painting: Consistent Style

```
A majestic snowy mountain range at dawn, with a small wooden cabin nestled in the foothills. In-paint the cabin to be twice as large, constructed of stone instead of wood, and add a chimney with smoke billowing out. Ensure the lighting and snow textures match the existing scene.
```

### In-Painting: Complex Object Insertion

```
A bustling marketplace in Marrakech, filled with vendors and shoppers. In-paint a futuristic hovering food stall in the middle of the scene, powered by glowing orbs and serving neon-colored drinks. The style of the stall should contrast sharply with the traditional market.
```

### In-Painting: Seamless Texture Extension

```
A close-up of a cracked and weathered brick wall. In-paint the wall to extend upwards, maintaining the same level of detail, weathering, and crack patterns as the existing wall. Make the extension three times the original height.
```

### In-Painting: Altering Material Properties

```
A shiny red sports car parked on a sunny street. In-paint the car to be matte black, covered in a thick layer of mud, and with several dents and scratches. The lighting should realistically reflect the altered surface properties.
```

### In-Painting: Detailed Character Modification

```
A portrait of a woman with long brown hair and a serious expression. In-paint her eyes to be bright blue, add a small silver nose ring, and give her a subtle smile. The changes should blend seamlessly with her existing features and skin tone.
