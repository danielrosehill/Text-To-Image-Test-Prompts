### 1. Change the Season (Style Transfer & Object Recognition)

**Base Image:** A photograph of a suburban house with a neatly manicured lawn in the summer.

**Prompt:** "Transform the image to depict the same house in autumn. Change the leaves on the trees to vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows. Scatter fallen leaves on the lawn. Add pumpkins and other autumnal decorations to the porch. Adjust the lighting to reflect the softer, golden light of autumn. Maintain the style of the original photograph. "
```

```
### 2. Add a Fictional Character (Object Insertion & Consistency)

**Base Image:** A photograph of a crowded New York City street scene.

**Prompt:** "Insert a photorealistic character of a Jedi Knight, complete with lightsaber (hilt only). The Jedi should be walking confidently through the crowd, but not directly interacting with anyone. The lighting and perspective on the Jedi should match the surrounding environment perfectly. The overall tonality of the image should not change."
```

```
### 3. Convert to an Art Style (Style Transfer & Detail Retention)

**Base Image:** a photo of a person standing next to a building.

**Prompt:** Transform the photo into a watercolor painting. Retain the overall composition and details of the original photograph. Emphasize loose brushstrokes, subtle color washes, and a slightly blurred, dreamlike quality. "
```

```
### 4. Add Weather Effects (Atmospheric Effects & Realism)

**Base Image:** A photograph of a mountain landscape on a clear, sunny day.

**Prompt:** "Add a dramatic thunderstorm to the scene. Darken the sky with heavy clouds. Add streaks of lightning, but don't make them too exaggerated. Add rain streaks to the foreground. Adjust the overall color palette to be cooler and more muted. Ensure that the light emitted from the lightning correctly illuminates the mountainside. Maintain a high level of realism."
```

```
### 5. Change the Time of Day (Global Illumination & Scene Understanding)

**Base Image:** A photograph of a park during the day. The sun is shining.

**Prompt:** "Transform the image to depict the same park at night. Illuminate the park with moonlight, streetlights, and interior light spilling from nearby buildings. Add subtle shadows and highlights to create a sense of depth. Adjust the color palette to be cooler and darker. Maintain the same overall composition. Ensure that the changed lighting is realistic and accounts for the change in the location of the sun."
